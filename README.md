## Self Hosting ‚òÅ

There is no way to self-host the infrastructure of LibreRemotePlay because it has no backend. But instead you can self-host if you want the TURN & STUN servers and then add them to the config.

- If you want to self-host a TURN/STUN server you can [try Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn). (This is only an example, you can choose other STUN/TURN implementations)

- Also you can host the Web version (but it is only frontend, so is not very usefull)
