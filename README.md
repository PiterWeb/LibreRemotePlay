### How it works üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This desktop APP is based on the WebRTC üéû standard and it uses the power of Go to communicate üó£ with the OS API's.
In Windows uses XInput API and the ViGEm Bus Driver with the ViGEm Client DLL

For the low level actions uses Go.
On the other hand the UI works with Web technologies (WASM, Sveltekit, Tailwind, DaisyUI & Typescript)

### Thanks to the ViGEm project ‚ô•
ViGEm is making this project a reallity. We embed ViGEm Installation Wizard and ViGEm Client DLLS within the executable for Windows
