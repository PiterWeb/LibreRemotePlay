## Self Hosting ‚òÅ

There is no way to self-host the infrastructure of LibreRemotePlay because it has no backend. But instead you can self-host if you want the TURN & STUN servers and then add them to the config or the [EasyConnectServer](https://github.com/PiterWeb/LibreRemotePlayEasyConnectServer).

- If you want to self-host a TURN/STUN server you can [try Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn). (This is only an example, you can choose other STUN/TURN implementations)

- Also you can host the Web version (but it is only frontend, so is not very usefull)

- If you want to self-host an EasyConnectServer you can follow the docs of [EasyConnectServer repo](https://github.com/PiterWeb/LibreRemotePlayEasyConnectServer), this service is also packed in the desktop app and run in app startup but instead you can launch it along. EasyConnectServer is a signaling server that makes code passing in an automatic way.

You may be interested in [GameLinkSafeCLI](https://github.com/PiterWeb/GameLinkSafeCLI) is like ngrok but works with TCP/UDP without account and no need to self-host in normal enviroments. 
Can be used like a hamachi alternative for gamers who are familiar with CLIs.
