# Contributing

## Requisites
  - ONLY work on an open issue if you want to merge it to the project (obviously you can open a new issue to enhance the features or correct any bug you found to work on it later)
  - Try to do self-explanatory code (if cannot be you can comment to enhance the comprehension)

## How to

  1. Fork this repository
  2. Clone it
  3. Work on the issue
  4. When you have finished make a pull request to merge it with the main branch
  5. Wait for merge (maybe it will not be merged at first because of bad code)
  6. Done

## Structure of the project

  - src/ (Golang / Wails)
  - frontend/ ( Typescript / Sveltekit - All the UI for the Desktop APP & the Web version)
